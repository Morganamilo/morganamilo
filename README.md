Hi, I'm Lu/Morganamilo, open source enthusiast who just likes making things.

I am a [staff member](https://www.archlinux.org/people/support-staff/#morganamilo) for Arch Linux. I mostly hack on Arch things and any projects I find interesting.

- I am a maintainer for the [pacman package manager](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman).
- I develop the AUR helper [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru), as well as contributing to other AUR helpers.
- I maintain [alpm.rs](https://github.com/Morganamilo/alpm.rs), complete, safe and  ergonomic rust bindings for libalpm.
- I also develop a handful of [rust](https://crates.io/users/morganamilo) and go libraries for interacting with pacman and the AUR.

Some of my Long term goals are:
- ~~Apply to become a [TU](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Trusted_Users) and package for [community]~~
    - Done! Now to maintain more packages
- Spend more time hacking on pacman and tackle [the many open issues](https://bugs.archlinux.org/index.php?project=3&do=index&switch=1).
- Keep the AUR free from bad packages with more PKGBUILD linting in makepkg.
- 32 bit binary builds, ~~integration tests and localisation~~ for paru.
    - Integration tests and localisation done!
- Make my projects more approachable with developer aimed documentation and mentoring.
- Blog posts explaining the ins and outs and caveats of pacman, libalpm, AUR helpers (if any one is interested).
